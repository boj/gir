Gir is a Twisted Matrix based IRC bot designed by Brian 'bojo' Jones,
and distributed under the same terms as the Twisted Matrix framework.

Gir's uniqueness is it's ability to dynamically load, reload, and unload
3rd party modules while actively running.  This gives module writers the
full capability of writing python based classes to extend gir's behavior,
and allow bot moderators to add functionality without taking their bot
offline.

Because gir is based on the Twisted Matrix python framework, this means
that it can also be extended to do other things such as jabber interfaces,
web, and so on.

Configuration:

Edit the config.ini file to change the settings for the bot.

Operator Commands:

!syshelp: Displays the following operator functions
!load <module>: Loads specified module
!reload <module>: Reloads specified module
!unload <module>: Unloads specified module
!instmods: Lists loaded modules
!listmods: Lists all available modules

Modules are referenced by their directory name in the modules directory.
